Qlora is a LoRa relaying package. Multiple devices can be strung up across long distances to allow for simple text based communication.

- Nodes are either relay or terminals
- Nodes can be configured directly or remotely
- Relay nodes feature a lower power standby mode that uses 80mW (from a 16V battery pack -> buck converter)
- Extensive debug features, such as copious logging and ignoring nodes in confined environments
- Currently no concept of authentication or encryption. Use at your own risk.
